Herein are the ClusterHQ Volume Hub Catalog Agents.

Install them on all the nodes in your Flocker cluster and they will push data from your cluster (volumes, containers, logs) into the Flocker volume hub.

# Install

If you already have a Flocker cluster, you can follow these instructions to install the catalog agents manually.

Before installing, register for a volume hub account at [https://clusterhq.com/volumehub](https://clusterhq.com/volumehub).

This will then guide you through setting up and installing the catalog agents.
